# Jarema's personal site

This site is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme based on my personal website.

It is primarily based on Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, with some amount of SolidJS for stateful components.

Theme inspired by [Astro Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere), [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me/), [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) and [Hayden Bleasel](https://www.haydenbleasel.com/).
