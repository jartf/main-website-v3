At CGV Cinemas, I was often the friendly face of the theater.

- I provided a warm welcome, efficiently handled ticket and concession sales, answered questions, and helped patrons find their seats.
- My role also involved giving clear directions to various areas within and around the cinema complex.
- Throughout my internship, I worked closely with my colleagues to maintain a smooth and enjoyable movie-going experience for all our customers.
