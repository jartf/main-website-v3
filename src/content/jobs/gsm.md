I consistently exceeded expectations while working as a Motortaxi Driver here.

- I upheld rigorous cleanliness and service standards while safely transporting thousands of passengers to their desired destinations. 
- My routes included bustling transportation hubs such as airports and train stations, as well as popular nightlife areas. 
- Passenger satisfaction was my top priority, and I achieved this by maintaining a clean and safe vehicle, readily answering questions about the area and local services, and ensuring a comfortable travel experience. 
- Additionally, I meticulously logged daily trips, including fares and destinations, to maintain accurate records for the company.
